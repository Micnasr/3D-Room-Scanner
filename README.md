 ## About
My mission is to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with our surroundings. Using a time of flight sensor, I have developed a system that can scan an entire room and generate a detailed image of its shape. It enables users to explore and analyze the spatial dimensions of any environment effortlessly. Whether it's for architectural design, virtual reality, or smart home applications, The sensor's precise measurements and high-resolution imaging capabilities will undoubtedly redefine the way we experience and understand the world around us.
